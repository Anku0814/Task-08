# Task 08

This repository contains the solution for **Task 08: Improving Predictions through Feature Engineering** using the **Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** dataset.

The goal is to apply effective **feature engineering** techniques and build a classification model that predicts whether a passenger survived (`Survived` = 0 or 1).

## Project Objectives

- Explore and understand the Titanic dataset.
- Handle **missing values** properly.
- Create new, meaningful features such as:
  - `Title` (extracted from passenger name)
  - `FamilySize`
  - `IsAlone`
  - `CabinKnown`
- Encode categorical variables using **One-Hot Encoding**.
- Train a **RandomForestClassifier** to predict survival.
- Evaluate the model using **Accuracy** and a **classification report**.
- Visualize **feature importance** for the engineered features.

This project is the complete solution for Task 08, where the objective is to apply effective feature engineering techniques on the Kaggle Titanic dataset to build a robust machine learning model that predicts passenger survival.

The goal is not just model accuracy, but also demonstrating strong data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature creation, and model interpretation skills.
